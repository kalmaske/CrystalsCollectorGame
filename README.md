# CrystalsCollectorGame

On the app works is that the player will be shown a random number and four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the total score.

	*the game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.

	*When player do click on a crystal, the player's score counter updates.

The player wins if her/his total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if her/his score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. 

Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values, and the player's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. 

To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
